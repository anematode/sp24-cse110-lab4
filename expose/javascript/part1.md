# Part 1

## Question 1

Line 9 prints 20.

## Question 2

Line 13 prints `undefined`. That's because the `var` definition was hoisted to the function level.

## Question 3

Line 9 still prints 20.

## Question 4

Line 13 throws an error, because `let` has block rather than function scope and so there is no variable named `result` in scope when we reach line 13.

## Question 5

The code throws an error because we try to assign a new value to the `const` variable result.

## Question 6

N/A, code throws an error
